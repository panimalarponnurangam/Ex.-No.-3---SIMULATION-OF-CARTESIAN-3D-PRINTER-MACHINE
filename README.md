SMOOTH ROD:
       A smooth rod typically refers to a cylindrical rod made of a smooth and rigid material, such as steel or aluminum. 
   It is commonly used as a linear motion guide or a support component in the construction of 3D printers, particularly 
  in the printer's gantry or carriage system.
  
BEARING : 
     Bearings refer to mechanical components used to facilitate smooth and low-friction movement of various parts within a 3D printer.
   They help to reduce friction and enable precise motion along linear axes, ensuring accurate and reliable operation of the printer's moving parts.
IDLER :
    The idler pulley helps to guide the belt along its path, reducing the chances of the belt slipping or jumping teeth and causing print defects.

EXTRUDER :
   Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed

MOTOR :
    Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

Y AXIS ASSEMBLY

Y AXIS SUPPORTER
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability.

Horiz. & Vertical Threaded Rod :
The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed

SMOOTH ROD :
The use of smooth rods in the printer's Y-axis mechanism helps to provide smooth and precise movement of the print bed

PULLEY :
pulley is often used in the Y-axis mechanism to transfer motion from the printer's stepper motor to the print bed.

MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes

Y AXIS FRAME :
It is responsible for support and stability of y axis frame.and also z axis.

Y AXIS BASE :
The Y-axis base is responsible for providing stability and support to the entire printer's structure, including the Y-axis frame, the print bed, and the printed 
bject.

Z AXIS ASSEMBLY

Z AXIS ROD :
The z-axis rod is responsible for supporting the weight of the print head and controlling its movement as it moves up and down during the printing process

Z AXIS TOP COVER :
The primary purpose of the z-axis top cover is to prevent dust and debris from settling on the z-axis rod, which can cause damage to the rod and the bearings that guide it

MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

COMPLETE ASSEMBLY

FRAME :
rigid structure that holds all the other components of the printer.

Y AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Y-axis is responsible for moving the print bed back and forth along the horizontal axis.

Z AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Z-axis is responsible for moving the print head up and down along the vertical axis.

X AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The X-axis is responsible for moving the print head back and forth along the horizontal axis.



SMPS :
convert ac to dc current.

LCD :
LCD screen provides a user-friendly interface that allows the user to control the printer and monitor its progress during printing.

SPOOL HOLDER :
It holds spool.

SPOOL :
A spool refers to a roll of filament that is used as the printing material for the 3D printer.
