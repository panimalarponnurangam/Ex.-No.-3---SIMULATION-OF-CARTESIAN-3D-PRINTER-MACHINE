###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Z-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Z-Axis Assembly from the list visible.
###   2.	All the parts related to Z-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.

###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Complete-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Complete-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Complete-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

SMOOTH ROD:
       A smooth rod typically refers to a cylindrical rod made of a smooth and rigid material, such as steel or aluminum. 
   It is commonly used as a linear motion guide or a support component in the construction of 3D printers, particularly 
  in the printer's gantry or carriage system.
  
BEARING : 
     Bearings refer to mechanical components used to facilitate smooth and low-friction movement of various parts within a 3D printer.
   They help to reduce friction and enable precise motion along linear axes, ensuring accurate and reliable operation of the printer's moving parts.
IDLER :
    The idler pulley helps to guide the belt along its path, reducing the chances of the belt slipping or jumping teeth and causing print defects.

EXTRUDER :
   Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed

MOTOR :
    Motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

Y AXIS ASSEMBLY

Y AXIS SUPPORTER
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability.

Horiz. & Vertical Threaded Rod :
The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed

SMOOTH ROD :
The use of smooth rods in the printer's Y-axis mechanism helps to provide smooth and precise movement of the print bed

PULLEY :
pulley is often used in the Y-axis mechanism to transfer motion from the printer's stepper motor to the print bed.

MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes

Y AXIS FRAME :





### Name: Panimalar.p
### Register Number:212222110031

## Result: 
### Thus the simulation on construction of cartesian 3D printer is completed & movement of axis along X, Y, & Z has been studied.
